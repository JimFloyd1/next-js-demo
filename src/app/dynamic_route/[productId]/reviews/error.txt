Error
Error automaticly wraps a route segment and its nested children in a react error boundry
this can create an error UI tailored to a specific sehments using the file-system hierarychy to adjust granularity

and to islate error to affected segments while keeping the rest of the applicaiton

add functionalty to attempt to recoever from an error without a full page reloaded

An error.tsx in a deeply nested folder will break the entire application

Error boundries have to be timed components in next.js

Handling errors in nested routes: errors bubble up to the closest parent error boundary
An error.tsx file will cater to errors for all its nested child segmentsBy positioning error.tsx
files at different level in the nested folder of a route you can acheieve a more granular
level of error handling
